I have drawn from the well of language many a thought which I do not have and which I could not put into words. C. G. Lichtenberg

Many who write about ‘linguistics’ go astray because they overlook the fundamental fact that we use words for two quite different purposes; as a code of communication whereby, as individual members of the human race, we can request and supply information necessary to life, and as Speech in the true sense, the medium in which, as unique persons who think in the first and second person singular, we gratuitously disclose ourselves to each other and share our experiences. Though no human utterance is either a pure code statement or a pure personal act, the difference is obvious if we compare a phrase-book for tourists travelling abroad with a poem.
LOCATION: 37

A poet, one might say, is someone who tries to give an experience its Proper Name, and it is a characteristic of Proper Names that they cannot be translated, only transliterated.
LOCATION: 43

Whereas most code statements are verifiable or disprovable, most personal utterances are neither; they can only be believed, doubted or denied. When we speak as persons, capable of good and evil, the important question is not ‘Is what we say the case or not?’, but ‘Are we speaking the truth, or deceiving ourselves, or deliberately lying?’
LOCATION: 46

But from the beginning, not only have men spoken many different languages, all subject to historical change, but also no two persons with the same mother-tongue speak it in exactly the same way. Understanding what another human being says to us is always a matter of translation. In this book, Mr Barfield is trying to help us to translate correctly, instead of making, as we all too often do, the most elementary errors.

True understanding is unattainable without both love and detachment, and we can only learn to view anything with detachment by comparing it with other things which are both like and unlike it. We cannot understand the present without a knowledge of the past, our native land without having spent some time in a foreign country, our mother-tongue without a working knowledge of at least two other languages. Without such knowledge, our love of ourselves at the present moment, of our country, of our language, remains an ignorant idolatry, exemplified by the Frenchman who said: “The great advantage of the French language is that in it the words occur in the order in which one thinks them.”

We can only cope with the dangers of language if we recognize that language is by nature magical and therefore highly dangerous. It will always be possible to use language, as a demagogue uses it, as Black Magic which neither. like a communication code, supplies people with information they need to know, nor, like Speech, asks for a personal and therefore…

Until quite recently, this did not matter very much. Before the spread of semi-literacy and the development of the mass media, the language used by the nine-tenths was the language they had learned at first-hand from their parents and their next-door neighbors. Their vocabulary might be limited, they might be aware of many of its possible meanings, but with it they were able to say what they meant to say and to understand what was said to them. Their ignorance of historical changes in the meanings of words was not a serious handicap because they could not or had no desire to read the literature of the past. The age of innocence, however, has come to an end and can never return. To-day, when all school children and college students are expected to read some English Literature, the consequence of such ignorance is that a nineteen-year-old,…
LOCATION: 75

To-day we must modify Mr Barfield's warning and say that nine-tenths of the population use twice as many words as they understand. It is no longer a matter of their knowing some of the possible meanings of the words they use; they attach meanings to them which are simply false. Thus one can hear a person, when he is feeling sick, say I am nauseous; a reviewer of a spy-thriller can describe it as enervating; a famous television star can call a firm of investment brokers, for which he is making a plug, integrity-ridden. So befuddled, how can the man-in-the-street be expected to resist the black magic of the propagandists, commercial and political…

Respect for the word is the first commandment in the discipline by which a man can be educated to maturity—intellectual, emotional and moral. Respect for the word—to employ it with scrupulous care and an incorruptible heartfelt love of truth—is essential if there is to be any growth in a society or in the human race. To misuse the word is to show contempt for man. It undermines the bridges and poisons the wells. It causes Man to regress down the long path of his evolution.

These are some of the many ways in which words may be made to disgorge the past that is bottled up inside them, as coal and wine, when we kindle or drink them, yield up their bottled sunshine.

Now the deduction of information from the presence or absence of certain words is a common practice which has been known to critics and historians of literature, under some such name as ‘internal evidence’, for many years. It is from such evidence, for instance, that we deduce Shakespeare's ignorance of the details of Roman civilization.

It has only just begun to dawn on us that in our own language alone, not to speak of its many companions, the past history of humanity is spread out in an imperishable map, just as the history of the mineral earth lies embedded in the layers of its outer crust. But there is this difference between the record of the rocks and the secrets which are hidden in language: whereas the former can only give us a knowledge of outward, dead things—such as forgotten seas and the bodily shapes of prehistoric animals…

The more common a word is and the simpler its meaning, the bolder very likely is the original thought which it contains and the more intense the intellectual or poetic effort which went to its making. Thus, the word quality is used by most educated people every day of their lives, yet in order that we should have this simple word Plato had to make the tremendous effort (it is one of the most exhausting which man is called on to exert) of turning a vague feeling into a clear thought. He invented the new word…
LOCATION: 155

Nor is the acquisition of such a feeling a waste of time; for once we have made it our own, it circulates like blood through the whole…
LOCATION: 161

But in order to excavate the information which is buried in a word we must have the means to ascertain its history. Until quite recently (about a hundred years ago) philology, as an exact science, was still in its infancy, and words were derived by ingenious guesswork from all kinds of impossible sources. All languages were referred to a Hebrew origin, since Hebrew was the language of the Bible. This was taken for granted. Since then, however, two new developments have revolutionized the whole study, made it accurate, and enormously extended its scope. During the eighteenth century Sanskrit, the ancient speech of the Hindoos, began for the first time to attract the attention of European scholars. In 1767 a French Jesuit named Coeurdoux pointed out certain resemblances between the European and Sanskrit languages. In 1786 Sir William Jones described that language as being ‘of wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a…

In most subsequent periods of history we have many other ways, besides the study of language, of discovering the outward circumstances of men's lives. Historical records, archaeology, ethnology, folk-lore, art, literature, all come to our help in considering, say, the ancient Egyptian civilization; but it is not so with the Aryans.
LOCATION: 213

If we wish to cross the darkness which separates us from this period we must lay down a little plank of words and step delicately over it.
LOCATION: 216

while the nineteenth century spent itself prodigally in multitudinous endeavours to know what the past was, it is now possible for us, by penetrating language with the knowledge thus accumulated, to feel how the past is.
LOCATION: 243

At some particular spot in the vast plains stretching from Eastern Europe to Central Asia it was as though a fresh spring bubbled up into the pool of humanity. Whether it represented the advent of a new ‘race-type’, what a race-type exactly is, and how it begins are questions which we must leave to others to settle. That spring was the Aryan culture.
LOCATION: 247

If we dig down far enough into the English language, we reach an old civilization flourishing somewhere round the banks of the Dnieper; of what was going on in these islands at that time we hear scarcely the faintest reverberation.
LOCATION: 262

It would be a great mistake to picture the Aryans setting out in some vast, organized expedition such as that of the Israelites under Moses. The study of comparative grammar suggests rather that they spread outwards from their centre in a series of little rills, each one, as it flowed, either pushing the rill in front of it a stage farther on, or flowing through it and passing beyond.

Meanwhile the south-eastern stream flowed past the Himalayas down into India and westward to Persia, where their descendants became the Brahmanic Hindoos and the Zoroastrian Persians of a later date.
LOCATION: 346

And then the north-western stream again sub-divided; and we will follow first of all that branch of it which dropped away southward into the Balkan peninsula and the islands of the Aegean.
LOCATION: 360

These young, light-hearted masters were called Greeks, or Hellenes; they migrated southwards in a series of waves, the first of which contained two tribes known as the Achaians and Danaans.
LOCATION: 369

Speech was a more miraculous and rhythmical thing to the Achaians than it is to us today, and whether or no the Gaelic bard is cognate with the Greek ‘phrazein’, to ‘speak’, there is no doubt that ‘epos’, the ‘word’, had its other meaning of ‘poem’.
LOCATION: 375

A single timid reference to ‘awful signs’,1 together with the absence of any ordinary word for ‘writing’, suggests that Homer's Achaians did not know how to write, and that his two long poems of twenty-four books each had to be memorized from beginning to end by that class of professional reciters from which our word rhapsody is derived.
LOCATION: 380

The Dorians settled in Laconia in the southern part of the Peloponnese or, as it is now called, the Motean peninsula. The notorious taciturnity of the inhabitants of Laconia has given us laconic, and we are referring to their rigid ideas on infant welfare when we speak of a ‘spartan mother’, for Sparta was the capital of Laconia.
LOCATION: 388

Attica, for a time the home of the Ionians (who eventually crossed the Aegean to Asia Minor), has a more complex history; and it was in Attica, in the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., that the Hellenic culture reached its finest flower.
LOCATION: 391

the names of many things which we regard as the very hall-marks of a cultured society can be traced back to the Attic dialect of this period. Academy, school, history, logic, grammar, poetry, rhythm, harmony, melody, music, are all from Greek works which were in common use in Athens, and the lasting influence of her sublime dramatic tradition is indicated by the great words, chorus, comedy, drama, theatre, and tragedy, and the lesser catastrophe, episode, prologue, and protagonist, all of which draw their meanings from the inspiration of the great Athenian dramatists.

The republic which they eventually established at Rome transformed itself into an empire that extended its bounds until they were coterminous with the civilized world—an empire of Europe and part of Asia which retained its real authority oven men's persons until the fifth century A.D.,
LOCATION: 406

There is, in fact, scarcely a word in our language expressing even remotely the notion of ‘authority’, which does not come to us from the Latin: authority, chief, command, control, dictator, dominion, empire, government, master, officer, rule, subordinate, are some of them; and it is significant that the two Greek words which we use to express the same idea are despot and tyrant.

It is a mark of affection when sailors drop the Latin captain and adopt the Dutch skipper, and the substitution by landsmen of Old High German boss for Latin manager seems to have begun in the same way.

Agriculture and war, we feel, were the primary businesses of life, and it was to these that the Roman mind instinctively flew when it was casting about for some means of expressing a new abstract idea—

Wherever we turn in our language, we have only to scratch the surface in order to come upon fresh traces of Rome and of her solid achievements in the world. With Greece, however, it is different. It was not the outer fabric of a future European civilization which the Greeks were building up while their own civilization flourished, but the shadowy, inner world of human consciousness.
LOCATION: 435

The language of the Old Testament is alone enough to tell us that, while the Greek Aryans had been pouring their vigour into the creation of intellectual wisdom and liberty, the Hebrews had been building up within themselves an extraordinary moral and emotional life, as narrow as it was intense.
LOCATION: 447

Thus, English words have little to tell us about the great migrations and massacres in Europe during the first ten centuries of the Christian era, for terms of abuse like vandal and hun draw their emotional force from the imaginations of historians rather than from actual contact with the tribes in question.

Throughout the course of history the many have accepted, as far as they were able, the thoughts which have been made for them by the few in the past, and the few have gone on constructing the opinion of the future.

If Christianity was to spread, it must be simplified. For these reasons the leading spirits gradually set their faces more and more rigidly against those long and laboriously evolved ideas which had actually created the language of the Gospels.
LOCATION: 1452

Moreover, in all but the strongest natures an extreme love of moral purity is often accompanied by an extreme love of exerting authority.
LOCATION: 1455

The stigma which still attaches to the ordinary Greek word for ‘choosing’ (heresy) is a fair indication of the zeal with which the early Popes and Bishops set about expunging from the consciousness of Christendom all memory of its history and all understanding of its external connections; while their success may be judged from the fact that as late as the last century an Englishman of public position who should have openly interpreted the Old Testament as Origen, for instance, interpreted it in the third century, would have incurred serious disabilities.
NOTE: Ref. Jewish Gospels, that one could be both Jewish and Christian before Constantine.
LOCATION: 1462

For example, at the end of the second century—no doubt with the object of distinguishing the Christian Mystery of incarnation, death, and rebirth from its many rivals—Tertullian fixed the Latin ‘sacramentum’ as the proper translation of ‘musterion’ instead of ‘mysterium’, which would probably have disappeared altogether had not Jerome restored it to partial use.
LOCATION: 1529

This great inner world of consciousness, we may suppose, which each individual was now felt to control in some measure for himself, was a thing to fear as well as to respect. It gave to every single soul almost infinite potentialities, for evil as well as good; and even the wisest heads seem to have felt that civilization could only be held together as long as all these souls maintained a certain uniformity of pattern.
LOCATION: 1639

The Arab seems to have possessed something of that combination of materialism on the one hand and excessive intellectual abstraction on the other which we have already noticed in the later stages of Roman mythology. Just as he made Mohammedanism out of the Jewish sacred traditions, so he made Nominalism out of Greek philosophy.
LOCATION: 1682

Nobody who understands the amount of pain and energy which go to the creation of new instruments of thought can feel anything but respect for the philosophy of the Middle Ages.

In spite of that strong and growing sense of the individual soul, man was not yet felt, either physically or psychically, to be isolated from his surroundings in the way that he is today. Conversely his mind and soul were not felt to be imprisoned within, and dependent upon, his body.

As with Aristotle, so with Bacon, it is impossible to say whether his own intellectual volume displaced the great wave or whether he merely rose upon its early crest.

The Reformation seems, with its insistence on the inwardness of all true grace, to have been but another manifestation of that steady shifting inwards of the centre of gravity of human consciousness which we have already observed in the scientific outlook.
LOCATION: 1958

Certain moral qualities gain respect for themselves; the respect brings with it material benefits; weaker brethren affect the moral qualities in order to acquire the material benefits; hypocrisy is detected; all morality is treated as hypocrisy. The trite little cycle spins like a whirligig round and round the social history of the world, but this is a good place to lay a finger on it, for it is a process in which the question of the meanings of words takes a particularly active part.
LOCATION: 2017

‘As for sin, let us call it folly and have done with it, for until we call it folly we never shall have done with it. The conception of sin flatters us grossly. There is something grandiose in it that cannot but appeal to the child in every man. That we infinitesimal creatures, scrambling like ants over the face of this minor planet in pursuit of our personal aims—that we have it in our power to affront the majesty of the universe is a most preposterous, delightful fancy…’
LOCATION: 2033

In order to enter sympathetically into the outlook of an educated medieval gentleman, we have to perform the difficult feat of undressing, as it were, our own outlook by divesting it of all those seemingly innate ideas of progress and evolution, of a movement of some sort going on everywhere around us, which make our cosmos what it is.
LOCATION: 2091

when we further reflect that it was the acute brains of these very doctors which were engaged in building up our present thinking apparatus, we may well feel inclined to give up as hopeless the task of sympathetically recreating the medieval cosmos in our imaginations—unless we realize, as indeed the history of meanings clearly shows, that it is not merely ideas and theories and feelings which have changed, but the very method of forming ideas and of combining them, the very channels, apparently eternal, by which one thought or feeling is connected with another.
LOCATION: 2105

At the beginning of the seventeenth century we first find the word Nature employed in contexts where medieval writers would certainly have used the single word God.
LOCATION: 2158

We begin to hear of people's autographs, of their foibles and their fortes; eccentric is taken from astronomy and mathematics; the Greek word idiosyncrasy—signifying an ‘individual mixture’ (of ‘humours’)—is borrowed from Galen; but with the new point of view the astrological and physical meanings of this and other words, like disposition, humour, spirits, temperament,…1 gradually fade away, and their modern meanings arise instead.
LOCATION: 2169

Thus, when a Roman spoke of events as auspicious or sinister, or when some natural object was said in the Middle Ages to be baleful, or benign, or malign, a herb to possess such and such a virtue, an eye to be evil, or the bones of a saint to be holy, or even, probably, when Gower wrote: The day was merry and fair enough, it is true that these things were described from the human point of view, but the activity was felt to emanate from the object itself. When we speak of an object or an event as amusing, on the contrary, we know that the process indicated by the word amuse takes place within ourselves; and this is none the less obvious because some of the adjectives recorded above, such as charming, enchanting, and fascinating, are the present participles of verbs which formerly did imply genuine, occult activity.
LOCATION: 2193

Perhaps the somersault was turned most neatly by the old Aristotelean word subjective, which developed in the seventeenth century from its former meaning of ‘existing in itself’ to the modern one of ‘existing in human consciousness’. Objective made a similar move in the opposite direction.
LOCATION: 2203

Intellectually, on the other hand, men's minds seem to have been influenced above all things by that conception of impersonal ‘laws’ governing the universe which, as we saw in the last chapter, was scarcely apprehended before the previous century. Poets and philosophers alike were delighted by the perfect order in which they perceived the cosmos to be arranged.
LOCATION: 2236

It is this universal conformity to laws, then, this perfect order reigning everywhere undisturbed, which the eighteenth century seems to have had in mind when it used, and sometimes personified, the word Reason. Reason explained everything.
LOCATION: 2247

At first sight this state of affairs looks like an exact repetition of the later stages of Roman mythology, but in point of fact the two outlooks are sharply distinguished by the new element of self-consciousness. Myth was in some way in the blood of the Romans; it was a living part of their national history, and in spite of all their artificiality and scepticism there is no evidence that they ever deliberately created gods and goddesses of the fancy, in whom they neither believed themselves nor expected anyone else to believe. We imagine them incapable of grasping, for instance, such an idea as that which found expression in the brand-new eighteenth-century verb, to personify. One wonders, therefore, to what extent the dawn of a mechanical age was reflecting itself in this new outlook,
LOCATION: 2273

Was the rhythmical mimicry of organic life, which is the characteristic of machinery, already having its unperceived effect on men's minds and philosophies? The influences which go to make up the outlook of an age are sometimes seen working most powerfully—though beneath the surface—in the very minds which believe themselves to be combating that outlook most stubbornly.
LOCATION: 2281

When it has done so, we are again reminded of the simple yet striking truth that all knowledge which has been conveyed by means of speech to the reason has travelled in metaphors taken from man's own activities and from the solid things which he handles. The present is no different from the past. Only the metaphors get buried deeper and deeper beneath one another; they interact more subtly, and do not always leave any outward trace on the language.
LOCATION: 2380

We think by means of words, and we have to use the same ones for so many different thoughts that, as soon as new meanings have entered into one set, they creep into all our theories and begin to mould our whole cosmos; and from the theories they pass into more words, and so into our lives and institutions. Thus, not only were the Newtonian heavens the playground of just those forces which had been used for the working of the six ‘simple machines’, but Montesquieu insists that the English Whigs copied the new astronomy when they were creating the modern British Constitution.
LOCATION: 2386

Environment, evolution, development, instinct, species, spontaneous, variation are some of the more important words, whose modern meanings, if we look at their semantic history, are found to bear the unmistakable stamp of Darwinism, and we ought perhaps to add ooze1 and slime.1 To Darwin we should have to attribute the tendency of evolution to lose its etymological suggestion of a vegetable growth, an unfolding from the centre outwards.
LOCATION: 2398

It is interesting to observe, that here again, as the words are commonly employed, the Latin form has grown more concrete and the Greek more abstract and intellectual.
LOCATION: 2407

At some period, however—perhaps in the last two centuries before our era—such a concept must have been precipitated, and we find Cicero defining the Latin ‘causa’, with mathematical precision, simply as ‘that which effects the thing of which it is the cause’. The fascination which this abstraction exerted on the medieval imagination may be judged from the fact that the writer of a fifteenth-century treatise on Love introduced into it the sentence: ‘Every cause of a cause is cause of thing caused ’; and we soon find the philosophers seeking through a ‘chain’ of causes for that First Cause, which they identified with the Almighty.
LOCATION: 2423

Under its influence even consciousness itself was, and still is, often conceived of as being caused by mechanical movements taking place within the body. We also find thought described as a function of the brain.
LOCATION: 2432

We drew from out our own bodies, it would seem, the sense-experiences of force and pressure and the like,1 on which mechanics are based; then we externalized them in tools and machines, and turned them into abstract ‘laws’; finally, we proceeded to reapply the ‘laws’ to the familiar objects from which we had first extracted them, and the result was that we turned our previous notions of these inside out.
LOCATION: 2437

Plato had deduced the sense-world from what we have called the inner world, and, while he had worked out an elaborate and wise knowledge of this inner world, with its moral impulses and aspirations, his philosophy had remained admittedly bankrupt as far as detailed knowledge of the mechanism of the outer world was concerned. Nineteenth-century science, on the other hand, deduced the inner from the outer; it had mapped and charted the mechanical part of Nature to a tenth of a millimetre,1 but it was wellnigh bankrupt as far as the inner world was concerned.
LOCATION: 2441

One of the few things about which practically all ‘men of science’, as the phrase now went, besides all those laymen who took the trouble to follow out the various scientific discoveries and to listen to their metaphysical reverberations, were agreed upon was that his senses and his reason had succeeded in placing man in a material environment which appeared to bear no relation whatever to his inner feelings and moral impulses.
LOCATION: 2447

The rapid conquest of intellectual Europe, which was achieved, not only by the general idea of evolution, but by the particular Darwinian theory of mechanical natural selection, is a matter of some surprise when we consider that a full acceptance of it necessitated a reversal of practically every metaphysical idea and feeling likely to be present in a nineteenth-century soul.
LOCATION: 2458

To minds thus attuned direct intervention by the divine at any one point in the natural process could only seem like an intolerable liberty; and feeling as well as thought began to revolt at the conjuring-tricks apparently reported in the Gospels.
LOCATION: 2477

Since the sense of freedom often appeareld at its strongest in imaginations which were most possessed with the mechanical view of the universe, the paradox was not infrequent—especially in Germany—of philosophers and scientists insisting fiercely on the freedom of thought and using it to deny the possibility of any freedom at all! Such thinkers found the word Determinism useful to express the mechanical part of the old predestination without the latter's theological assumptions.

It was the philosophy of the Lake School that the perception of Nature—that is to say of all in Nature that is not purely mechanical—depends upon what is brought to it by the observer.
LOCATION: 2750

And so it is in the philosophy and poetry of Romanticism that we first feel a true understanding, not indeed of the process itself, but of the results of that process, which has been traced in this book under the name of ‘internalization’. Slowly the divers of the Romantic expedition brought up to the surface of consciousness that vast new cosmos which had so long been blindly forming in the depths. It was a cosmos in which the spirit and spontaneity of life had moved out of Nature and into man. The magic of Persia, the Muses of Greece, the witches and fairies and charms and enchantments of Romance—all these had been locked safely in man's bosom, there to sleep until the trump of Romanticism sounded its call to imagination to give back their teeming life to Nature.
LOCATION: 2763

And this re-animation of Nature was possible because the imagination was felt as creative in the full religious sense of the word. It had itself assisted in creating the natural forms which the senses were now contemplating. It had moved upon the face of the waters. For it was ‘the repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation’—the Word made human.
