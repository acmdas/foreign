Barbarians who have made it into the Empire have been transformed into the complacent and the compliant, commonly but incorrectly known as ‘citizens’.

Slaves are equal. But only citizens are free. You can’t be both. And in the Empire, the emphasis is on equality. Guess what they’re telling us?

You’ll know you are truly free when most people despise you for your apparent lack of ‘human respect’ when you reject the accepted wisdom of the day.

Don’t believe the common wisdom that says Barbarians were the cause of the destruction of the Western Empire. Actually, they were the primary force that helped it last as long as it did.

Here’s what you really need to know in order to understand the basics of Economics; if you spend more than you make, you are in a state of debt, which is akin to slavery. If you make more than you spend, you are in a relative state of wealth, which is another way of saying freedom. If you unfairly take more than you give, you are in a larcenous state. If you freely give more than you take, you are in a charitable state.

Because man has a free will in the monotheistic world, he can alter his future by the exercise of his own free will, in the choice he makes about Faith.
LOCATION: 760

Only when you make a choice in the absence of total knowledge are you making a bet. And that is what we do when we profess to believe in a particular god or God, because we cannot prove to anyone else’s total satisfaction that a particular one actually exists.
LOCATION: 771

OK, so what if you bet on a slot, and there is no God (or even ‘gods’). Well, as Pascal would say, what have you lost? Nothing. Because if there is no afterlife, your life meant nothing. So again, what have you lost? Nothing. So here’s the deal; everything versus nothing. Get it? Free bet. But what if there is, and you haven’t made a bet? That is the ultimate bad bet, in my book.
LOCATION: 783

If it was undeniably evident which one was the winner, there wouldn’t be any need for faith, would there?
NOTE: No need for faith, but also no, or little, freedom. Maybe the Creator values freedom. Maybe there is value in creations who have freely chosen to, what? To follow? To join? To participate?

These clues lead me to believe that there will be a final showdown between ’The God’ and ‘the gods’. And while every man has to face this battle personally in his own life, there will also be a collective, all-encompassing battle directly between these two at the end. And that’s what this book is leading to: The Last Fall.

Does it promise us anything of great value or reward? Like mercy? Does it have an unbroken line of priestly or kingly succession till today? Does it have a believable and desirable Messiah?

They think the symbol of the manna is replaced by the ‘symbol’ of the Eucharist, which they claim is only ‘symbolic’ of the Body & Blood of Jesus. Now, how smart is that? The purpose of a symbol is to point towards a reality. Why replace one symbol with another? Where does this process stop? Or is it like Hinduism, where there is an endless reincarnation of symbols?

Now ‘change’ may sound like a great concept, and politically it is a best seller. But in reality, in a mature civilization, ‘change’ is actually another word for ‘revolution’. It also goes by the names of ‘Innovation’ and ‘Subversion’. Don’t mistake this word for ‘maturing’ or ‘organic growth’. Change is exactly that, a change, morphing from one thing into another. ‘Change’ represents the abandonment of that which already exists, and that is definitely a threat to what currently exists. Politically and religiously speaking, this is rebellion, and it will always draw a response from any regime intent on survival.

But there’s a problem here for these shepherds, grandson. You want to believe you’re worth something, anything. And you even want to believe your sheep are worth something as well, as this would give some value to your life and work. And here’s this guy Jesus who says indeed, you’re worth a lot, at least to him. He’s even willing to die for you, he says. And he says he’s the Son of God. And he does all these incredible things. You really want to believe in him. But if you do, there’s still no payoff here and now. And he teaches people that revolution is not the answer. So you’ve got to sit and wait, and at the same time you have to get rid of your hatred, envy and disgust for the rich and the powerful. And worst of all, if you tell anyone you believe in him, you just might get the same welcome the apostles and the disciples would all get- instant death. Wow, how desirable!

Protestantism in its distilled form can best be known as ‘radical individualism’, while Orthodoxy is ‘radical collectivism’. They appear to be opposite in form, yet both lead directly to the denial of ‘the Family’ which is the core building block of Holy Roman Christianity. Now ask yourself, ‘if I want to destroy Christianity, what is the best means of attack?’ Well, anything that tends to
LOCATION: 2050

destroy the core unit of construction results in this desired destruction. But you can’t fight something with nothing, and thus we have these two radical efforts to re-define Christianity by changing the mode of its construction.

Orthodoxy is nothing but a schismatic quarrel designed to preserve the local power of the local hierarchy, in the service of the local political power, to the detriment of overall Christian unity.

“Photius of Constantinople, chief author of the great schism between East and West, was b. at Constantinople c. 815 (Hergenröther says “not much earlier than 827”, “Photius”, I, 316; others, about 810); d. probably 6 Feb., 897. His father was a spatharios (lifeguard) named Sergius. Symeon Magister (“De Mich. et Theod.”, Bonn ed., 1838, xxix, 668) says that his mother was an escaped nun and that he was illegitimate. He further relates that a holy bishop, Michael of Synnada, before his birth foretold that he would become patriarch, but would work so much evil that it would be better that he should not be born. His father then wanted to kill him and his mother, but the bishop said: “You cannot hinder what God has ordained. Take care for yourself.” His mother also dreamed that she would give birth to a demon. When he was born the abbot of the Maximine monastery baptized him and gave him the name Photius (Enlightened), saying: “Perhaps the anger of God will be turned from him” (Symeon Magister, ibid., cf. Hergenröther, “Photius”, I, 318-19).” 16 (end of citation)

Now that brings up the question of why a loving God would send nice people to Hell. Well, he doesn’t. We send ourselves, by refusing the invitation to the wedding feast. We insult the host by refusing to show up, usually because we’re ‘too busy’. Or if we do come, we show up for a wedding dressed like slobs.
LOCATION: 4328

So here’s a clue: the real God has taste. Show up on time and dress right. And don’t insult the host.
LOCATION: 4330

Likewise with ‘the gods’, who are still motivated by their original sin, the sin of Pride. And being so much smarter than men, when we come to the issue of Conspiracies, it’s silly to think that human conspiracies can hold a candle to supernatural conspiracies. And remember this, as you keep in mind the saying that ‘there is no honor among thieves’, there are multiple conspiracies amongst ‘the gods’ too. Why would we think that they are in complete lock-step agreement among themselves when, after all, they each fell from grace for the sin of pride, according to the Judeo-Christian history (‘the Bible)? They weren’t proud of each other, they were proud of themselves.
LOCATION: 4333

And so, we have to make a distinction here between the two types of conspiracies. The gods make up a story and sell it to stupid gullible men with the intention of ensnaring them when they pay any attention to it, either by resisting or by cooperating. That’s why conspiracy theories that involve the supernatural must never be believed by intelligent men, because the storyline isn’t what it appears to be. So all those stories about the Illuminati, the Templars, the Rosicrucians, etc, are nothing more than bait for curious gullible men. Curiosity kills cats, and idiots too. Even if everything these theories said was true, it wouldn’t matter, because the story originated from the gods.
LOCATION: 4345

ultimately everything the gods (demons) tell you is a lie.
LOCATION: 4350

Anyway, the whole point of each supernatural conspiracy is not to enslave all men on earth (although that may be their supposed stated purpose), but rather to intellectually capture a certain sub-set of mankind with each variant of the story of Icarus; that is, how to impose or escape the maze? I’ve got news for you my boy- nobody escapes alive. We all die in the maze. The only difference among men is how you treat each other while living in the maze.

Am I being anti-Semitic here? I don’t think so. I’m just being historically accurate. And the reality is, there’s not a lot of operational difference between the Empire and the Chosen Ones. But there is an essential difference between these two groups. Both of them are composed of Mammonites, who, as we have already seen, are those who worship money. But like most else in life, there are two kinds of Mammonites; those who covet power to gain money, and those who covet money to gain power.

So, what in the world does any of this have to do with my claim that England became the Third Rome? Simple, my son. Angland couldn’t become the successor to the Empire as long as it was still a loyal part of Holy Rome. Holy Rome forbids usury, which is the black-magic heart of the act of lending for profit. Angland had to become pagan again before the Empire, and more importantly, the ones who finance the Empire, would move their operations there. Since the Imperial Roman Operating System was based on theft, Angland had to accommodate this system. And that’s what happened. The benefit London received for this was that, as the new home base of the Empire, you got to steal from a lot more people than just your own native population. You could now steal from the world.

So anyone with a brain knew that future earnings were tied to the sea-trade. Germany and all the Scandinavian countries (except Norway, which was also too damn cold) could be bottled up with a simple blockade of the Baltic Sea. No, the winner of this Empire Olympic competition would have to be a place where the Chosen Ones and their newly-financed Caesar were relatively safe from Papal invasion and naval blockades. And that would be Angland.

Anyway, Henry was pretty cagey, and he had paid close attention to the ‘national church’ model set up by the original protestants, known as The Orthodox churches of the east, in 1054 AD.
LOCATION: 4505

Henry then passed out most of the land (he kept the golden treasure) to his friends. This created a large new nobility that was entirely beholden to him for their wealth, and who were bound by pledge to defend him with their local armies. So, in one fell swoop, Henry shattered the Church, the Nation, the Family.
LOCATION: 4515

Anyway, Henry eventually dies, but his dynasty is established through his bastard daughter, Elizabeth the First (aka The Worst). Old Queen Bess was pretty mean herself, killing off her half-sister (the legitimate Queen) and any cousins that looked dangerous to her and her throne. And about 30,000 other fools who forgot to duck. By this time the renegade Cardinals and Bishops that had helped Henry break away from Holy Rome had been busy ‘cleansing’ the new Anglican Church of any ‘Popish’ influences. That cleansing included stepping on the necks of anyone that dared to resist (like St. Thomas More and St. John Fisher), as well as any ‘free-thinkers’ that thought the brand-new Anglican Church was still too ‘Popish’. In other words, anybody that looked cross-eyed was a suspect to Elizabeth and her crowd.
LOCATION: 4520

So, the ‘free-thinking’ Puritans (known as ‘Dissenters’) were suspected of disloyalty to the new God of Mammon, just as the remaining Catholics were under suspicion. But there was one group that wasn’t suspect, even though, eventually, they would produce all kinds of weird offshoots to the Anglican Church. Groups like The Seventh Day Adventists, the Christian Scientists, and other Judaizing sects. So just what group was this that wasn’t suspect in the eyes of the Bastard Queen? It was the British Israelites. Huh? The what? Well, remember when I said there were 2 main groups of human conspirators? This is the first one.

The Whigs represented new wealth, not connected with the land but rather with manufacturing and trade. They weren’t nobles, but they did accumulate vast wealth. They did this by herding all the poor dispossessed peasants from the countryside into the cities, where they worked in the new factories. Before this new Industrial Age, the peasants had tilled the monastic Church lands for centuries, with hereditary rights to their plots. But the new nobility threw them off those lands when Henry confiscated the monasteries (the Enclosure Laws). The former peasants were now ‘laborers’ who worked for starvation wages. Think of Charles Dickens and his ‘Christmas Carol’ story. Think of Ebenezer Scrooge when you think of the Whigs. And then realize that until the time of Henry and Elizabeth, wide-scale poverty had been unknown in Britain. Why? Because the Holy Roman Church had always been their safety net in times of trouble.
LOCATION: 4595

But make no mistake, they were both totally opposed to Holy Rome, because both received their new wealth from the theft of the monasteries from Holy Rome. And this was the beginning of what we know as Capitalism today.

‘Society of the Elect’, and recruited a number of interesting people, including Lord Salisbury, who, theoretically, from a class perspective, should have been his enemy. But some things trump class. Things like world power. Oh, and guess who else belonged to this club? Lord Rosebery (Rothschild). Coincidence, I’m sure. Hahahahah! The result of this secret society was the spawning of a number of seemingly different groups, all of whom had a common membership which had two common links. The first was an affiliation with Oxford University. The second was an undying commitment to Anglish world domination. They recruited key members throughout the British Empire, in each of its provinces and Dominions. Now keep in mind that at this time (around the time of Benjamin D’Israeli in 1870, whom we discussed earlier) the British Empire included Australia, Canada, almost all of southern Afrika, Egypt, India (which originally stretched from present day Pakistan to Burma) and dozens of other countries. Here is part of the old Wikipedia entry on the Commonwealth today (entry was updated in January 2013):

So, who were these groups, made up of men like Rhodes and Lord Salisbury, who on the surface seemed to be implacable political enemies? Here are the names of a few of these groups: The Round Table Group, the Royal Institute for International Affairs, The Times of London, The Institute of Pacific Relations, and in America, The Council on Foreign Relations. And by the way, just a quick note that will become relevant later in this book; all Mormons are also British Israelites, by definition. Their theology says that they are the descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel. And as we all (should) know, it was legal to have multiple wives in Old Israel. So, what’s good enough for Israel is good enough for Utah, right? Connecting any dots here? Good.

Don’t believe me about Churchill? Read his own words in Nicholson Baker’s book, ‘Human Smoke’. Winston is probably the man most responsible for the Jewish Holocaust, because he was far-sighted enough to know that if he refused to take in the (little) Chosen Ones, Hitler would do exactly what he did. Once Winston sank the Free French Fleet (yes, his own allies) off the coast of Algeria (where it was holed up after Paris fell to the Germans), Hitler had no way of sending all the Jews to Madagascar, which was his preferred ‘final solution’. He needed those French warships to accomplish this task, which he openly touted as his preferred plan of action to rid Europe of the Jews. Don’t believe it? Look it up, grandson.

And in return for trading away their real freedoms, the purchasing power actually increased for those ‘citizens’ who still had jobs, which is most of them (as the cycle began). How is that? Well, you get to buy goods made by slaves now, in a global economy. That’s always cheaper than citizen-wage-grade goods. And these same compliant ‘citizens’ were also rewarded with greater ‘freedom’ in the areas of sexuality, religion and politics (the three unmentionables of polite society). But in the end (and it happens rather quickly) they become economic slaves as their appetites outstrip their fading incomes. Then they face the inevitable decision- shall I continue to submit (that is, vote

These three fronts are disguised as the War on Poverty (which destroys Blacks), the War on Drugs (which destroys the Latino races) and the War on Terror (which destroys the Muslims lands). Make no mistake, each of these lands and races are being punished for not succumbing to the population-economics of the Empire. And the basic element of this war is population control. And the root tactic of this desire to dominate, this Libido Dominandi, is the desire to destroy the family unit. Why? Because the family is the first step, the first link in building the armor that defends the faith and fatherland. Once the family is atomized, breaking apart into radical individuals, then no one has any allies with which to resist the Empire. You have no one to call on for help when your family (and clan and then tribe) isn’t there. Next thing you know, your church and country, which are simply larger versions of your family, have also vanished.

And now we are at the last stage of the Three Front War. This war began as one waged against religion of one kind (Holy Rome), and governments of one kind (monarchy). And now, it is being finished off with a war against the family of one kind, (the traditional family). Why? Because at the end, The Empire will present each man, separated and isolated from all other men, with a single choice, and it will be an economic choice. It won’t be a demand to drop your religious beliefs. Why? Because they will have already been destroyed, as your religion will have morphed into membership in the new world religion. It won’t be a demand to drop your national allegiance, either. Why? Because all nations will have been destroyed by globalism. It won’t even be a demand that you abandon your familial allegiance, because the family was destroyed at the personal level, starting with Henry and ending with the Three Front War. No, the only choice all men will have at the end of this unwinding of the Empire will be this; do you want a job, or not? If not, fine, go starve. But if you do want a job, do as you’re told, and you’ll get to keep your cable, your subsidized food and housing, and your clothes. And maybe a car. Maybe. But maybe it will be a bike, who knows?

We then looked at how the Empire was first divided into East and West, and how, when Constantinople fell in 1453 AD, there began the struggle amongst all the nations of Europe, including Russia, to claim the throne of Caesar. But it was not to be in the east but rather in the west that the Empire would settle, in Angland, the land of the faithless monarchs. The land that knew that the key to winning Caesar’s crown lay with the re-admission of Caesar’s financiers, the tax-farming Chosen Ones. And the re-admission of ‘the gods’ as she reverted to her pre-Roman pagan past.

And we have talked about the ‘anti-miracles’, as I call them, found in the writings of the Chosen Ones, in their own Talmudic descriptions of the events that transpired from 30 AD to 70 AD, when their hopes of earthly victory vanished. The astronomical odds of the Black Lot coming up 40 years in a row. The massive Temple doors swinging open every night. The snuffing of the Holy Lamp every night for 40 years, in spite of every precaution. The red sash not turning white from the time of the crucifixion, for 40 years. What could it mean, you idiot Pharisees? What could it mean, you silly Weiner-Dogs? Hahahah! I can’t believe how anyone of integrity could read these passages and still maintain their resistance to simple logic and math. Which is another way of saying I don’t think any of these people who tout the ‘history written by the winners’ has any integrity. Idiots. Mammonite idiots.

The only difference is that in a Global world, where all economies intersect and communications are instantaneous, there’s no time for passions to subside in the event of any particular occurrence. Every occurrence is now a local event. Think globally, act locally, as the saying goes among the eco-evo crowd. The problem is, there’s no such thing as ‘local’ anymore, because everything is global. And vice versa, paradoxically. In other words, we’re at critical mass. And anything can be the trigger event. Anything, anywhere, anytime.

The Empire has been eternally uncomfortable in the presence of this one man, this Jesus, after he declined their offer to join their Pantheon.

Oh, did I mention that the changed basilicas (church buildings) were stripped of statues? Especially those of Mary, the Beautiful Lady? The Palladium of Holy Rome?

‘Japheth will dwell in the tents of Shem.’ And the Khazars were of Japheth’s tribe, but then they converted to Judaism (the religion of Shem-ites).

Well, let’s ask ourselves a few pertinent questions here. How many Chosen Ones were saved by Winston, the Eastern Emperor, and Angland in WWII? How many by the Western Emperor, FDR? How many were saved by the Hindus? How many by the Russians? How many by the Confucians? And most importantly, how many were saved by the big-shot Chosen Ones in the Western Empire, and in London? How many did the Rothschild’s save? How many did the Warburg’s save? How many did the Kuhn’s save? How much money did the big shot Chosen Ones spend trying to save their continental kin in WWII? I’ll tell you the answer- the Pope, Pius XII, saved more than all of these combined! Hell, Gen. Tojo saved more in Japan and China than all of these others besides the Pope.

So which is it? Words or actions? But before you answer, remember The Iliad and The Odyssey. Most importantly, The Odyssey. Remember their themes. Wrath and Deceit. And remember that the core lesson of history is that most men are liars. Especially the leaders. And their key tactic is deceit. That’s why you’re having such a hard time here. Quit listening, ignore the labels! Look only at their actions.
