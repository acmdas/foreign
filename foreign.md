# The Past Is A Foreign Country

Notes for the book about Barfield’s/Harold’s notions about consciousness and the consequences of the same

*The past is a foreign country; they do things differently there* L.P. Hartley, *The Go-Between* (1953)

Leslie Poles Hartley was born on 30 December, 1895 in Whittlesey, Cambridgeshire.

That’s certainly a striking image—the past being a foreign country...is it true? How foreign? How past? Five hundred years? How foreign was Tudor England? How different from us was Shakespear? How much do we misunderstand his plays if we read them as being by someone like us who just uses ‘thees and thous’ instead of ‘you and yours’?

How different was Jesus or Paul? Different enough that we misunderstand what is written in the Bible? Of course, they spoke Aramaic and Greek, but do our translations take into account that they were perhaps more foreign than we understand? Than we can understand?

And how foreign was Plato and Aristotle, Cicero and Caesar Augustus? Can we understand?

How ‘past’ does it have to be to be foreign? Descartes? Voltaire? Thomas Jefferson? Lincoln?Marx? Woodrow Wilson? FDR? Kennedy?

Does it matter? Can we either ignore the past, or reinterpret it by reading everything as it it had been written yesterday? Or today?
