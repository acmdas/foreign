True understanding is unattainable without both love and detachment, and we can only learn to view anything with detachment by comparing it with other things which are both like and unlike it. We cannot understand the present without a knowledge of the past, our native land without having spent some time in a foreign country, our mother-tongue without a working knowledge of at least two other languages. Without such knowledge, our love of ourselves at the present moment, of our country, of our language, remains an ignorant idolatry, exemplified by the Frenchman who said: "The great advantage of the French language is that in it the words occur in the order in which one thinks them."

Until quite recently, this did not matter very much. Before the spread of semi-literacy and the development of the mass media, the language used by the nine-tenths was the language they had learned at first-hand from their parents and their next-door neighbours. Their vocabulary might be limited, they might be aware of many of its possible meanings, but with it they were able to say what they meant to say and to understand what was said to them. Their ignorance of historical changes in the meanings of words was not a serious handicap because they could not or had no desire to read the literature of the past. The age of innocence, however, has come to an end and can never return. To-day, when all school children and college students are expected to read some English Literature, the consequence of such ignorance is that a nineteen-year-old, confronted with the lines, The agèd bloodhound rose and shook his hide, But his sagacious eye an inmate owns. can interpret them as follows: "The poor dog was blind. Some lunatic had punched his eye out and kept it."

To-day we must modify Mr Barfield's warning and say that nine-tenths of the population use twice as many words as they understand. It is no longer a matter of their knowing some of the possible meanings of the words they use; they attach meanings to them which are simply false. Thus one can hear a person, when he is feeling sick, say I am nauseous; a reviewer of a spy-thriller can describe it as enervating; a famous television star can call a firm of investment brokers, for which he is making a plug, integrity-ridden. So befuddled, how can the man-in-the-street be expected to resist the black magic of the propagandists, commercial and political? Formerly, philology could remain a study for specialists: to-day, History in English Words, and other books like it, must he made required reading in all schools.

/Respect for the word is the first commandment in the discipline by which a man can be educated to maturity---intellectual, emotional and moral./

/Respect for the word---to employ it with scrupulous care and an incorruptible heartfelt love of truth---is essential if there is to be any growth in a society or in the human race./

/To misuse the word is to show contempt for man. It undermines the bridges and poisons the wells. It causes Man to regress down the long path of his evolution./

It has only just begun to dawn on us that in our own language alone, not to speak of its many companions, the past history of humanity is spread out in an imperishable map, just as the history of the mineral earth lies embedded in the layers of its outer crust. But there is this difference between the record of the rocks and the secrets which are hidden in language: whereas the former can only give us a knowledge of outward, dead things---such as forgotten seas and the bodily shapes of prehistoric animals and primitive men---language has preserved for us the inner, living history of man's soul. It reveals the evolution of consciousness.

The more common a word is and the simpler its meaning, the bolder very likely is the original thought which it contains and the more intense the intellectual or poetic effort which went to its making. Thus, the word quality is used by most educated people every day of their lives, yet in order that we should have this simple word Plato had to make the tremendous effort (it is one of the most exhausting which man is called on to exert) of turning a vague feeling into a clear thought.

while the nineteenth century spent itself prodigally in multitudinous endeavours to know what the past was, it is now possible for us, by penetrating language with the knowledge thus accumulated, to feel how the past is.

VI: Philosophy and Religion

from ear her Greek thought LOCATION: 1265

Throughout the course of history the many have accepted, as far as they were able, the thoughts which have been made for them by the few in the past, and the few have gone on constructing the opinion of the future. LOCATION: 1428

In Palestine Jesus of Nazareth lived and taught and died. As the years passed by, an increasing number of sages and religious teachers began to agree among themselves that recently something had actually occurred which had before only been talked about or erroneously believed to have occurred. Certain of the Jews, for instance, admitted that their Messiah had now come and gone. Egyptians and followers of the Egyptian cults were persuaded that a real Horus had been born of a virgin, and had risen again as an Osiris. Some of the more forward-looking among those who had been initiated into the Mysteries felt that what had so often been enacted dramatically within the sacred precincts had now taken place in a peculiar way on the great stage of the world, this time not for a few, but for all to see. A God had himself died in order to rise again to eternal life. Thus, those who had not been initiated--the poorer classes, most of the women, and the slaves--had a joyous feeling that at last the Mysteries had been revealed, that 'many things which were hid had been made plain'. And some students of Platonic philosophy could admit that this might be true, that henceforth those who could not rise to the contemplation of the eternal in Nature might yet win immortality by contemplating the life and death of Jesus. For they could see in Christ one who had first taught in a new and simpler way, and had then himself demonstrated, a truth which nearly every one of the Greek philosophers, including Aristotle, had been trying to say all their lives--that, in order to achieve immortality, it is necessary to 'die' to this world of the senses and the appetites, and that he who thus 'dies' is already living in eternity during his bodily life and will continue to do so after his bodily death. 'Whosoever shall lose his life shall find it.' In the Christ the Logos of Philo and his school had become incarnate in human form, the Word had become Flesh.

Such were some of the numerous ideas and emotions which had become embedded in the Greek language by the time, somewhere about a hundred years after His death, the life of Christ was written by the four Evangelists and others. Out of these ideas and emotions arose, in the first place, the dogma and ritual of the Catholic Church, and in the second place a great part of the ordinary thoughts and feelings and impulses of will which flourish in the bosoms of modern Europeans and Americans.

Very early in its career the leaders of the infant Church must have realized two things--firstly, that those who, like the Gnostics, were passionately interested in philosophical and mystical interpretations of the life of Christ, not only differed very widely among themselves, but also often paid little attention to that personal life of Jesus, as recorded in the Gospels, whose sweetness was beginning to bind men together with marvellous new ties; secondly, that the simple and ignorant people to whom, according to the Gospels, Jesus addressed Himself almost exclusively, would be quite incapable of grasping these interpretations. If Christianity was to spread, it must be simplified. For these reasons the leading spirits gradually set their faces more and more rigidly against those long and laboriously evolved ideas which had actually created the language of the Gospels. LOCATION: 1452

Moreover, in all but the strongest natures an extreme love of moral purity is often accompanied by an extreme love of exerting authority. LOCATION: 1455

The stigma which still attaches to the ordinary Greek word for 'choosing' (heresy) is a fair indication of the zeal with which the early Popes and Bishops set about expunging from the consciousness of Christendom all memory of its history and all understanding of its external connections; while their success may be judged from the fact that as late as the last century an Englishman of public position who should have openly interpreted the Old Testament as Origen, for instance, interpreted it in the third century, would have incurred serious disabilities. LOCATION: 1462

VII: Devotion

For example, at the end of the second century---no doubt with the object of distinguishing the Christian Mystery of incarnation, death, and rebirth from its many rivals---Tertullian fixed the Latin 'sacramentum' as the proper translation of 'musterion' instead of 'mysterium', which would probably have disappeared altogether had not Jerome restored it to partial use. LOCATION: 1529

This great inner world of consciousness, we may suppose, which each individual was now felt to control in some measure for himself, was a thing to fear as well as to respect. It gave to every single soul almost infinite potentialities, for evil as well as good; and even the wisest heads seem to have felt that civilization could only be held together as long as all these souls maintained a certain uniformity of pattern. LOCATION: 1639

The Arab seems to have possessed something of that combination of materialism on the one hand and excessive intellectual abstraction on the other which we have already noticed in the later stages of Roman mythology. Just as he made Mohammedanism out of the Jewish sacred traditions, so he made Nominalism out of Greek philosophy. LOCATION: 1682

Nobody who understands the amount of pain and energy which go to the creation of new instruments of thought can feel anything but respect for the philosophy of the Middle Ages. LOCATION: 1715

In spite of that strong and growing sense of the individual soul, man was not yet felt, either physically or psychically, to be isolated from his surroundings in the way that he is today. Conversely his mind and soul were not felt to be imprisoned within, and dependent upon, his body. LOCATION: 1721

VIII: Experiment

As with Aristotle, so with Bacon, it is impossible to say whether his own intellectual volume displaced the great wave or whether he merely rose upon its early crest. LOCATION: 1871

The Reformation seems, with its insistence on the inwardness of all true grace, to have been but another manifestation of that steady shifting inwards of the centre of gravity of human consciousness which we have already observed in the scientific outlook. LOCATION: 1958

IX: Personality and Reason

Certain moral qualities gain respect for themselves; the respect brings with it material benefits; weaker brethren affect the moral qualities in order to acquire the material benefits; hypocrisy is detected; all morality is treated as hypocrisy. The trite little cycle spins like a whirligig round and round the social history of the world, but this is a good place to lay a finger on it, for it is a process in which the question of the meanings of words takes a particularly active part. LOCATION: 2017

'As for sin, let us call it folly and have done with it, for until we call it folly we never shall have done with it. The conception of sin flatters us grossly. There is something grandiose in it that cannot but appeal to the child in every man. That we infinitesimal creatures, scrambling like ants over the face of this minor planet in pursuit of our personal aims---that we have it in our power to affront the majesty of the universe is a most preposterous, delightful fancy...' LOCATION: 2033

In order to enter sympathetically into the outlook of an educated medieval gentleman, we have to perform the difficult feat of undressing, as it were, our own outlook by divesting it of all those seemingly innate ideas of progress and evolution, of a movement of some sort going on everywhere around us, which make our cosmos what it is. LOCATION: 2091

when we further reflect that it was the acute brains of these very doctors which were engaged in building up our present thinking apparatus, we may well feel inclined to give up as hopeless the task of sympathetically recreating the medieval cosmos in our imaginations---unless we realize, as indeed the history of meanings clearly shows, that it is not merely ideas and theories and feelings which have changed, but the very method of forming ideas and of combining them, the very channels, apparently eternal, by which one thought or feeling is connected with another. LOCATION: 2105

At the beginning of the seventeenth century we first find the word Nature employed in contexts where medieval writers would certainly have used the single word God. LOCATION: 2158

We begin to hear of people's autographs, of their foibles and their fortes; eccentric is taken from astronomy and mathematics; the Greek word idiosyncrasy---signifying an 'individual mixture' (of 'humours')---is borrowed from Galen; but with the new point of view the astrological and physical meanings of this and other words, like disposition, humour, spirits, temperament,...1 gradually fade away, and their modern meanings arise instead. LOCATION: 2169

Thus, when a Roman spoke of events as auspicious or sinister, or when some natural object was said in the Middle Ages to be baleful, or benign, or malign, a herb to possess such and such a virtue, an eye to be evil, or the bones of a saint to be holy, or even, probably, when Gower wrote: The day was merry and fair enough, it is true that these things were described from the human point of view, but the activity was felt to emanate from the object itself. When we speak of an object or an event as amusing, on the contrary, we know that the process indicated by the word amuse takes place within ourselves; and this is none the less obvious because some of the adjectives recorded above, such as charming, enchanting, and fascinating, are the present participles of verbs which formerly did imply genuine, occult activity. LOCATION: 2193

Perhaps the somersault was turned most neatly by the old Aristotelean word subjective, which developed in the seventeenth century from its former meaning of 'existing in itself' to the modern one of 'existing in human consciousness'. Objective made a similar move in the opposite direction. LOCATION: 2203

Intellectually, on the other hand, men's minds seem to have been influenced above all things by that conception of impersonal 'laws' governing the universe which, as we saw in the last chapter, was scarcely apprehended before the previous century. Poets and philosophers alike were delighted by the perfect order in which they perceived the cosmos to be arranged. LOCATION: 2236

It is this universal conformity to laws, then, this perfect order reigning everywhere undisturbed, which the eighteenth century seems to have had in mind when it used, and sometimes personified, the word Reason. Reason explained everything. LOCATION: 2247

At first sight this state of affairs looks like an exact repetition of the later stages of Roman mythology, but in point of fact the two outlooks are sharply distinguished by the new element of self-consciousness. Myth was in some way in the blood of the Romans; it was a living part of their national history, and in spite of all their artificiality and scepticism there is no evidence that they ever deliberately created gods and goddesses of the fancy, in whom they neither believed themselves nor expected anyone else to believe. We imagine them incapable of grasping, for instance, such an idea as that which found expression in the brand-new eighteenth-century verb, to personify. One wonders, therefore, to what extent the dawn of a mechanical age was reflecting itself in this new outlook, LOCATION: 2273

Was the rhythmical mimicry of organic life, which is the characteristic of machinery, already having its unperceived effect on men's minds and philosophies? The influences which go to make up the outlook of an age are sometimes seen working most powerfully---though beneath the surface---in the very minds which believe themselves to be combating that outlook most stubbornly. LOCATION: 2281

X. Mechanism

When it has done so, we are again reminded of the simple yet striking truth that all knowledge which has been conveyed by means of speech to the reason has travelled in metaphors taken from man's own activities and from the solid things which he handles. The present is no different from the past. Only the metaphors get buried deeper and deeper beneath one another; they interact more subtly, and do not always leave any outward trace on the language. LOCATION: 2380

We think by means of words, and we have to use the same ones for so many different thoughts that, as soon as new meanings have entered into one set, they creep into all our theories and begin to mould our whole cosmos; and from the theories they pass into more words, and so into our lives and institutions. Thus, not only were the Newtonian heavens the playground of just those forces which had been used for the working of the six 'simple machines', but Montesquieu insists that the English Whigs copied the new astronomy when they were creating the modern British Constitution. LOCATION: 2386

Environment, evolution, development, instinct, species, spontaneous, variation are some of the more important words, whose modern meanings, if we look at their semantic history, are found to bear the unmistakable stamp of Darwinism, and we ought perhaps to add ooze1 and slime.1 To Darwin we should have to attribute the tendency of evolution to lose its etymological suggestion of a vegetable growth, an unfolding from the centre outwards. LOCATION: 2398

It is interesting to observe, that here again, as the words are commonly employed, the Latin form has grown more concrete and the Greek more abstract and intellectual. LOCATION: 2407

At some period, however---perhaps in the last two centuries before our era---such a concept must have been precipitated, and we find Cicero defining the Latin 'causa', with mathematical precision, simply as 'that which effects the thing of which it is the cause'. The fascination which this abstraction exerted on the medieval imagination may be judged from the fact that the writer of a fifteenth-century treatise on Love introduced into it the sentence: 'Every cause of a cause is cause of thing caused'; and we soon find the philosophers seeking through a 'chain' of causes for that First Cause, which they identified with the Almighty. LOCATION: 2423

Under its influence even consciousness itself was, and still is, often conceived of as being caused by mechanical movements taking place within the body. We also find thought described as a function of the brain. LOCATION: 2432

We drew from out our own bodies, it would seem, the sense-experiences of force and pressure and the like,1 on which mechanics are based; then we externalized them in tools and machines, and turned them into abstract 'laws'; finally, we proceeded to reapply the 'laws' to the familiar objects from which we had first extracted them, and the result was that we turned our previous notions of these inside out. LOCATION: 2437

Plato had deduced the sense-world from what we have called the inner world, and, while he had worked out an elaborate and wise knowledge of this inner world, with its moral impulses and aspirations, his philosophy had remained admittedly bankrupt as far as detailed knowledge of the mechanism of the outer world was concerned. Nineteenth-century science, on the other hand, deduced the inner from the outer; it had mapped and charted the mechanical part of Nature to a tenth of a millimetre,1 but it was wellnigh bankrupt as far as the inner world was concerned. LOCATION: 2441

One of the few things about which practically all 'men of science', as the phrase now went, besides all those laymen who took the trouble to follow out the various scientific discoveries and to listen to their metaphysical reverberations, were agreed upon was that his senses and his reason had succeeded in placing man in a material environment which appeared to bear no relation whatever to his inner feelings and moral impulses. LOCATION: 2447

The rapid conquest of intellectual Europe, which was achieved, not only by the general idea of evolution, but by the particular Darwinian theory of mechanical natural selection, is a matter of some surprise when we consider that a full acceptance of it necessitated a reversal of practically every metaphysical idea and feeling likely to be present in a nineteenth-century soul. LOCATION: 2458

To minds thus attuned direct intervention by the divine at any one point in the natural process could only seem like an intolerable liberty; and feeling as well as thought began to revolt at the conjuring-tricks apparently reported in the Gospels. LOCATION: 2477

Since the sense of freedom often appeareld at its strongest in imaginations which were most possessed with the mechanical view of the universe, the paradox was not infrequent---especially in Germany---of philosophers and scientists insisting fiercely on the freedom of thought and using it to deny the possibility of any freedom at all! Such thinkers found the word Determinism useful to express the mechanical part of the old predestination without the latter's theological assumptions. LOCATION: 2504

XI: Imagination

It was the philosophy of the Lake School that the perception of Nature---that is to say of all in Nature that is not purely mechanical---depends upon what is brought to it by the observer. LOCATION: 2750

And so it is in the philosophy and poetry of Romanticism that we first feel a true understanding, not indeed of the process itself, but of the results of that process, which has been traced in this book under the name of 'internalization'. Slowly the divers of the Romantic expedition brought up to the surface of consciousness that vast new cosmos which had so long been blindly forming in the depths. It was a cosmos in which the spirit and spontaneity of life had moved out of Nature and into man. The magic of Persia, the Muses of Greece, the witches and fairies and charms and enchantments of Romance---all these had been locked safely in man's bosom, there to sleep until the trump of Romanticism sounded its call to imagination to give back their teeming life to Nature. LOCATION: 2763

And this re-animation of Nature was possible because the imagination was felt as creative in the full religious sense of the word. It had itself assisted in creating the natural forms which the senses were now contemplating. It had moved upon the face of the waters. For it was 'the repetition in the finite mind of the eternal act of creation'---the Word made human. LOCATION: 2775
