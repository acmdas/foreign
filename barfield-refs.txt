Writing/acmdas/consultingsmiths-2019-04-13 .md:## Owen Barfield
Writing/acmdas/consultingsmiths-2019-04-13 .md:Owen Barfield (1898–1997)
Writing/acmdas/consultingsmiths-2019-04-13 .md:Barfield was writing for everybody and for all time — his core concern was nothing less than the divine destiny of each individual person and of all people collectively.
Writing/acmdas/consultingsmiths-2019-04-13 .md:Barfield's immediate relevance is profound; it is to solve the core problem of modern times - which is 'alienation': i.e. the deep sense of meaninglessness, purposelessness, and isolation from people and things.
Writing/acmdas/consultingsmiths-2019-04-13 .md:Barfield's scheme is that humans began as conscious-but-not-free; and we evolved — evolved in the sense of changing by unfolding according to a (divine) developmental plan — to become free but not conscious (which is where we are now, in modern times — unaware of meaning, purpose, relation) — and we ought to be aiming at the condition where we are both self-aware and fully-conscious. Engaged with (and participating in) reality as free agents.
Writing/acmdas/consultingsmiths-2019-04-13 .md:Barfield proposes real, coherent, and clear answers to the most fundamental problems.

Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/WorldsApart.html:<p>‘sinceyou have very fairly asked for it here goes.’ Few, if any, people are capable at all events in our time of conversing in the manner which has become traditional in philosophical dialogues from Plato to Brewster and Lowes Dickinson; and not many even of those who can think well and coherently have the faculty of clothing their thoughts ex tempore in linked and properly constructed sentences. Chatterboxes apart, I have never in my life heard anyone, who was not actually delivering an address or giving a lecture, continue to speak without pause or interruption for as long as ten minutes. It will be obvious then to the reader that the tape-recording of what passed between us during our (to me) memorable week- end is, in form though not in substance, a very different matter from this book which my friend Owen Barfield, who could not unfortunately be one of us, has kindly composed from it, with such additional help here and there as my memory afforded.

Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>We should remember this, when appraising the aberrations of the formally representational arts. Of course, in so far as these are due to affectation, they are of no importance. But in so far as they are genuine, they are genuine because the artist has in some way or other experienced the world he represents. And in so far as they are appreciated, they are appreciated by those who are themselves willing to make a move towards seeing the world in that way, and, ultimately therefore, seeing that kind of world. We should remember this, when we see pictures of a dog with six legs emerging from a vegetable marrow or a woman with a motorbicycle substituted for her left breast.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>Saving the Appearances</em></p>

Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“When the velocity of progress increases beyond a certain point, it becomes indistinguishable from crisis.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>Night Operation</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“We can only cope with the dangers of language if we recognize that language is by nature magical and therefore highly dangerous.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>History in English Words</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“All conscious nature has experiences of pleasure and pain. Man alone can deliberately will the repetition of an experience. And repetition, experienced as such, is at the heart, for good and evil, of his faculty of reasoning, and thus makes possible his language, his art, his morality, and indeed his humanity. Yet it is the enemy of life, for repetition is itself the principle, not of life but of mechanism.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>Orpheus: A Poetic Drama</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“There is no surer or more illuminating way of reading a man’s character, and perhaps a little of his past history, than by observing the contexts in which he prefers to use certain words.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>History in English Words</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“…library terror - that feeling of being hopelessly overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of available books…” ― Owen Barfield, <em>Night Operation</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“I believe I have already suggested that colour is the most obvious bridge between emotion and perception, that is, between subjective experience of the psyche and quality objective in nature. Both light up only between the extremes of light and darkness, and in their reciprocal interplay. Thus, outward the rainbow–or, if you prefer it, the spectrum–is the bridge between dark and light, but inwardly the rainbow is, what the soul itself is, the bridge between body and spirit, between earth and heaven.” ― Owen Barfield</p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“True understanding is unattainable without both love and detachment, and we can only learn to view anything with detachment by comparing it with other things which are both like and unlike it. We cannot understand the present without a knowledge of the past, our native land without having spent some time in a foreign country, our mother-tongue without a working knowledge of at least two other languages. Without such knowledge, our love of ourselves at the present moment, of our country, of our language, remains an ignorant idolatry, exemplified by the Frenchman who said: “The great advantage of the French language is that in it the words occur in the order in which one thinks them.” In” ― Owen Barfield, <em>History in English Words</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“If people say the world we perceive is a ‘construct’ of our brains, they are saying in effect, that it results from an inveterate habit of thought. Why does it never occur to them that a habit is something you can overcome, if you set about it with enough energy?” ― Owen Barfield</p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“When a new thing or a new idea comes into the consciousness of the community, it is described, not by a new word, but by the name of the pre-existing object which most closely resembles it.” ― Owen Barfield, History in English Words</p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“True understanding is unattainable without both love and detachment,” ― Owen Barfield, <em>History in English Words</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“Therefore it is only people living in the same period and, broadly speaking, in the same community, who inhabit the same world. People living in other periods, or even at the same period but in a totally different community, do not inhabit the same world about which they have different ideas, they inhabit different worlds altogether.” ― Owen Barfield</p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“When we recall the great influence which Spenser’s poetry has exerted on English poets who have lived and written since his day, we can clearly see how the two kinds of Platonism - a direct Platonism, and a Platonism long ago transmuted and worked right down into the emotions of common people by the passionate Christianity of the Dark and Middle Ages - combined to beget the infinite suggestiveness which is now contained in such words as ‘love’ and ‘beauty’. Let us remember, then, that every time we abuse these terms, or use them too lightly, we are draining them of their power; every time a society journalist or a film producer exploits this vast suggestiveness to tickle a vanity or dignify a lust, he is squandering a great pile of spiritual capital which has been laid up by centuries of weary effort.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>History in English Words</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“Before the scientific revolution, [man] did not feel himself isolated by his skin from the world outside to quite the same extent that we do. He was integrated, or mortised into it, each different part of him being united to a different part of it by some invisible thread. In his relation to his environment, the man of the middle ages was rather less like an island, rather more like an embryo.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>Saving the Appearances: A Study in Idolatry</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“As we see it, the whole outlook brought about by the scientific revolution should have been–must be–a phase, only, of the evolution of consciousness. An absolutely indispensable phase, but a passing one. What is riveting it on to us and preventing us from superseding it, because it prevents us from even imaging any other kind of consciousness, is precisely this error of projecting it back into the past.” ― Owen Barfield, <em>Worlds Apart</em></p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“If I find it depressing when a distinguished literary critic complains that ‘Coleridge has little insight into the incompatibility of different trends of thought,’ it is because this seems to me to betray a deplorable inability to distinguish between philosophy and talking about philosophy.” —Owen Barfield, <em>How Coleridge Thought</em> p. 7</p>
Writing/acmdas/das_fieldstones/barfield_quotes.html:<p>“The intensities must be at once opposite and equal. As the liberty, so must be the reverence for law. As the independence, so must be the service and submission to the Supreme Will.” —Samuel Taylor Coleridge, <em>The Nature of Life</em> found in Owen Barfield, <em>How Coleridge Thought</em> p. 9</p>

Writing/journal.txt:Describes Godel as a Platonist, and it struck me that there's a pretty clear link to Barfield's *Saving the Attachments* with Plato's reality outside the cave corresponding to Barfield's unrepresented. A later or at least further development of the idea in TheSS that there's a tremendously important link between our spiritual life and physics.
Writing/journal.txt:I wonder what Barfield has to say about how to read Plato considering his *initial participation*.
