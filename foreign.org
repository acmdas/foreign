Coleridge topics important to Barfield include imagination and polarity.

"It is easy to appreciate that there is no such thing as an unseen rainbow. It is not so easy to grasp that there is no such thing as an unheard noise. Or rather it is easy to grasp, but difficult to keep hold of. And this is still more the case, when we come to the sense of touch. Obvious as it may be to reflection that a system of waves or quanta or discrete particles is no more like solid matter than waves of air are like sound, or raindrops like a rainbow, it is not particularly easy to grasp, and it is almost impossible to keep in mind, that there is no such thing as unfelt solidity.¹ It is much more convenient, when we are listening for example to the geologist, to forget what we learnt about matter from the chemist and the physicist. But it really will not do. We cannot go on for ever having it both ways." -- Chapter 3

While the quote "The past is a foreign country..." refers to, well, the past, and is significant to both Barfield and Harold, both also make it clear that the future is a foreign country as well. In fact, as Barfield says in /Saving the Appearances/ (Chapter III, p. 23) in reference to the way that we accept the testimony of current physics about the increasingly weird nature of “reality” including that of Carlo Rovelli in /The Order of Time/ that there really is no time, there are no objects, only events, and yet we ignore that testimony immediately as we turn to our “regular” lives, “But it really will not do. We cannot go on for ever having it both ways.”

Note that Troward begins the Edinburgh Lectures by pointing out that the table in front of him seems solid and isn't. Also note that Troward led me to TheSS.

The project will need to address both the past and the future, taking into consideration C.S. Lewis’s saying, “You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”

What are the consequences of accepting, and researching, the past with the understanding that human consciousness is constantly evolving, and to meaningfully “read, mark and inwardly digest” what the past is saying, or was saying, we must try to understand and accept those differences. And we need to be aware as we look at our own Alpha and Beta thinking, that we are creating “reality” with our own, idiosyncratic consciousness, idiosyncratic not only because or our point in the evolutionary flow, but also as individuals, with our own set of experiences and influences. What does that mean for us at this moment, and how do we deal with the idea that we create “time” which doesn’t really exist!

Polarity is a topic that he took from Coleridge.

That's certainly a striking image---the past being a foreign country...is it true? How foreign? How past? A hundred years? Five hundred years? How foreign was Tudor England? How different from us was Shakespear? How much do we misunderstand his plays if we read them as being by someone like us who just uses 'thees and thous' instead of 'you and yours'?

How different was Jesus or Paul? Different enough that we misunderstand what is written in the Bible? Of course, they spoke Aramaic and Greek, but do our translations take into account that they were perhaps more foreign than we understand? Than we can understand?

And how foreign was Plato and Aristotle, Cicero and Caesar Augustus? Can we understand? How about the people who built the pyramids or Stonehenge? Are the people who say that the pyramids were built by aliens more right than wrong?

How 'past' does it have to be to be foreign? Descartes? Voltaire? Thomas Jefferson? Lincoln? Marx? Woodrow Wilson? FDR? Kennedy? Can I, in 2021, understand what Kennedy said when I was a teen-ager? Can my kids? Or what Reagan said when I was in my thirties? Or what I said or wrote when young or middle-aged? Can I throw my mind back to the person that I was then? Or is it an issue—is the answer “of course, why not?”

Does it matter? Can we either ignore the past, or reinterpret it by reading everything as if it had been written yesterday? Or today? What would we gain, or lose, if we do?

And what about today, which will be the foreign past to tomorrow? Our Science Fiction stories project people like us into the near or far future, and we wonder whether the space ships, laser weapons, faster-than-light travel, wars with aliens are in any way “realistic.” Do we ever ask ourselves how realistic it is to expect those future people to think just like we do, for our consciousness to never evolve? Or to have never evolved to bring us to who we are today? It’s easy to say, “Certainly, our minds are evolved from our Homo Erectus ancestors of a million years ago.” It gets trickier, though, when we get to Homo Sapiens. We have been “modern humans” for hundreds of thousands of years (just how many depends on which expert you ask). Have we always thought the way we do now?

How could we know? All we have of Homo Erectus is some bones and stone tools. We can surmise that there was enough consciousness to make those tools, but nothing that can tell us much about that consciousness. Homo Sapiens? For most of those hundreds of thousands of years, the situation is much the same—some bones, some tools, and some context—ashes that indicate the use of fire, animal bones that indicate the ability to hunt. Perhaps carefully arranged bones of a woman and an infant that suggests relationship and possibly belief in an afterlife. Still, precious little to base a “they were just like us/they were completely different from us” judgement.

Looking ahead with current idealist philosophy, psychology of consciousness, leading-edge physics. Where are we heading? Are we stuck here? Carlo Rovelli says that there are no objects, only events. Nothing /is/, everything /happens/.

I’m sitting at my old, brown wooden desk, my old computer keyboard at hand, a bright winter afternoon light coming in the window. That I know—sort of. Being moderately well-educated in the mid 20th century, I know that the desk, the keyboard, the window, even the light aren’t “really” anything like I envision them. They (with the possible exception of the sunlight) are all mostly open space with infinitismal atoms spaced out—except that the atoms are in fact mostly open space with protons, neutrons and electrons—except protons, neutrons and electrons are in fact bundles of even smaller subatomic particles—except ultimately none of them really exist if we look closely enough. For over a century, we’ve known—or at least a century ago some of our leading physicists knew and those of us who are just “moderately well-educated” have gotten a glimmer of knowing—that ultimately there are only “quantum events”. And one of those leading physicists a century ago who led the development of quantum theory, Niels Bohr, has said, “Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it." And Richard Feynman, another of the physicists who has played a fundamental role in developing quantum mechanics, has said, “If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics.” 

And recently, Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli has said that, at the quantum level, that is, at it’s basic level, there not only isn’t anything like what we think of as matter—there isn’t even time as we now it. “We cannot think of the physical world as if it were made of things, of entities. It simply doesn’t work.” “The world is not a collection of things, it is a collection of events.”

Because I’m a moderately well-educated I’ve gotten accustomed to living with the idea that the light coming in my window took 8 minutes to get from the sun to my eyes going 186,000 miles a second, and that starlight takes at least years, perhaps millions of years to arrive. And that there are more atoms of water in the glass at my elbow than there are stars in the Milky Way, and that my desktop is mostly empty space. I’ve known these things most of my life, and I have no problem acting as if none of it were true. I swallow a sip of water, not trillions of molecules made up of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen, and set the glass on my solid desktop, and watch the sun dip below the horizon as night falls. Yes, I’m a master of ambiguity.

And there’s really no other way for me to behave, being a human being in the third decade of the twenty-first century. But still, every now and then I wonder just how it is that “I” create the world that I occupy out of that sea of quantum events. And more than that, that the world that “I” create seems to be so very similar to the world that you create.

And if we are creating a common, agreed upon reality amongst ourselves, have we always done it the same way, or has it evolved over time. Is the past really a foreign country specifically because “they do things differently there?”

A fascinating idea—how interesting it would be if we could only tell, somehow. Did our ancestors think and see the world the same way that we do? Did Plato’s words mean the same thing to him that they do to us? If only there was some way to tell!

Saw an article on The Feynman Technique and it struck me that I might use it to write this:

1. Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.
2. Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.
3. Organize and simplify.
4. Transmit (optional).

There was a time that I was pretty good at “instructional design” - maybe I could be again?

Quote from Anias Nin: “We don’t see things as they are; we see them as we are.”

“Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”—Philip K. Dick

In light of the early chapters of “Saving...”, what does that say about reality? Surely, the tree doesn’t “go away” if I believed that it is an Ent, and then am “disabused” of that belief, but it does change fundamentally.

And is the opposite true? “Reality is that which is there because you and another person experience it?”

When we take “Science” into consideration, “Reality” gets complicated. Surely, my body is real. So is this desk and the floor. Of course, we’ve known for some time that things like my body and the desk and floor are made up of atoms with immense spaces between them, and that the atoms themselves are made of electrons, protons and neutrons with immense spaces between them, and that electrons, protons and neutrons are made up of, well, is it really “elephants all the way down?” How far “down” does it go, and of all of those “elephants” which or what is “real”?

And what about time? If what’s really real is the lowest elephant, the “mechanical quanta” and we’re utterly unable to experience the real reality, at least we have time in common all up and down the stack of elephants. We know that’s real - there’s a past and a future and now. Right? Maybe not.

But maybe what really matters isn’t the really real, the bottom elephant, but the top one, the one that we experience as “consensus reality”. Whether I believe in it, it doesn’t go away. Whether I think that big oak is an ent or “just a tree”, it’s still there. It doesn’t matter what I think of it...or does it?

“Ideally, what should be said to every child, repeatedly, throughout his or her school life is something like this: ‘You are in the process of being indoctrinated ... What you are being taught here is an amalgam of current prejudice and the choices of this particular culture. The slightest look at history will show how impermanent these must be. You are being taught by people who have been able to accommodate themselves to a regime of thought laid down by their predecessors. It is a self-perpetuating system.’” — Doris Lessing

*** Introduction

Today’s besetting sin, at least for those of us born or trained into Modern Western ways of thought, is Pride. I suppose that I’ve identified myself as having been thus born or trained by being so bold as to declare what “our” besetting sin “is”, and so I must continue by justifying this claim.
